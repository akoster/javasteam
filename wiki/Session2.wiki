Java through commandline
  * source code resides under a source directory, i.e. 'src/main/java' or 'src/test/java' in a normal Maven project.
  * each top-level class is represented by a separate file ('App.java') which is stored in a directory matching the java package namespace ('nl\javasteam\helloworld').
  * package + classname is called the fully qualified classname. For example 'nl.javasteam.helloworld.App'
  * to compile App.java from the source directory type: 
    javac nl\javasteam\helloworld\App.java
  This creates the file 'nl\javasteam\helloworld\App.class'
  * to run it type: java -cp . nl.javasteam.helloworld.App
