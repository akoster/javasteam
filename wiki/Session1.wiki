Install java 6 JDK

Install Eclipse Galileo (3.5)

Install Subclipse plugin
    * in Help -> Install new software
    * Add site Subclipse 1.6 - http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.6.x
    * Select subclipse module and accept all defaults
    * Go to SVN repository exploring perspective

JavaSteam google code project
    * Add user to project on http://code.google.com/p/javasteam/
    * Generate googlecode password for user on Source -> Checkout tab
    * Add repository https://javasteam.googlecode.com/svn (refers to JavaSteam Google code project)

Install Maven 2.2.1 and create project
    * Add system environment variabel MAVEN_HOME pointing to maven install directory
    * Add %MAVEN_HOME%\bin to system path
    * Open DOS box in Eclipse workspace directory
    * execute: mvn archetype:generate
    * Select maven-quickstart archetype and answer questions, this generates a simple project structure
    * execute: mvn eclipse:eclipse(switch to new generated directory in the workspace directory), this generates Eclipse settings (.project & .classpath)
    * import project into Eclipse: import -> Project -> browse to root directory
    * Configure build path -> Add variable M2_REPO = [YOUR_HOME_DIR]\.m2\repository. This is needed to tell Eclipse where to find the dependencies managed by maven

Check project into Subversion
    * project -> Team -> Share project
    * Choose SVN (not CVS)
    * Choose our google code repository
    * Choose project name as directory name (javasteam)
    * Eclipse switches to Team synchronization perspective
    * Remove from view: target, .project and .classpath (these are Eclipse specific/generated files which we don't want in our code repository)
    * Commit and enter a comment
    * Switch to Java perspective
    * svn:ignore the three files not committed above 
    * Commit the svn:ignore (this is a Subversion property on a directory)
